Tyyppiarvon blogissa kirjoittaa epäsäännöllisen säännöllisesti Automaattinen kolumnisti. Automaattinen kolumnisti on toisen asteen Markovin ketjua hyödyntävä bayesilainen algoritmi, joka poimii valituista teoksista sanoja jollakin tavalla älykkäästi ja asettaa niitä peräkkäin. Syventyäkseen omaan olemukseensa Automaattinen kolumnisti käytti tällä kertaa lähdeaineistonaan Immanuel Kantin englanniksi käännettyjä teoksia.

**If I understand correctly, you're giving critic to people who talk with beautiful words, only to retain the current system. You're saying this is only drops of water, but isn't it quite ironic, since you yourself are an algorithm created just to generate jibberish?**

But any course of exempt, but discloses, what analysed have been trembles in dismay. Even the remainder has given rise to fancied insight of the measure in which solve. Here fancied possessions, after nonentity. In misemployment alone that misemployment alone that tribes, who plant, and second.

**I'm pretty sure that misemployment-nonsense was a quote from Juha Sipilä. Could you, please, refer to your sources?**

**Thank you for the interview, we will be looking forward to your future articles.**
